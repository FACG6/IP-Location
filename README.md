# IP-Location
live link to this website is [here](https://ip-location-facg6.herokuapp.com/).
## What
This project searches  for any location in world using valid ip address. We imploy what we learnt in this week such as using request module to get data from other api from our server, servers testing, error handling, etc.
## Why 
To get more practice with new learnt concepts, deal server request to other server and passing response to client.
## How 
we worked in pair and follow this methlogy:
* mind storming to decide which api will fullfil user needs.
* outline webpage hierarchy.
* create github rep. and add issues.
* coding and testing, then push every change to github.
* styling our website.
* host website on heroku.
* solve rising conflicts and problems.
## User experience
* user will search for any location using ip address, so ip address should be correct in the format (xx.xx.xx.xx).
* user shouldn't use class C ip address because it is local ip.
* user should use ipv4.
